Section 1 - Assignment Instructions

Please refer to the below spreadsheet shared in the resources:
'AWS+Sol+Arch+2020+Study+Tracker.xlsx'

You will note that this spreadsheet has a tab for each of the 5 major sections of this course. Under each of those sections, we have listed the major topics to focus on. Note that these are exactly what we focused our lectures around.

For each item, there is a rating column and a notes column. A suggested rating scale for this course would be:
- 1 - "I have never heard of this technology before!"
- 2 - "I have heard of it before and I think I know what it does."
- 3 - "I could teach someone the basics of this technology using a whiteboard."
- 4 - "I understand beyond the basics of this technology and could suggest a rough design where needed."
- 5 - "I could assist with designing a detailed architecture that calls upon this technology."

You should note that you can easily pass this exam without taking EVERY topic to a level 5. Use the Practice Exams at the end of the course to help you with gauging your exam readiness.
